    <div class="overview">
        <p>Mental health is an important part of a person’s overall well-being. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (n.d.), 
            it includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being.The goal of the website is to bring more insight to this matter and to decrease the stigma around it. 
            Talking about mental health should not always revolve around the issues but also how it affects everyone’s day to day life.

                <h1>A.R.M. in Arm</h1>
                <p>A.R.M. in Arm is a process of dealing with mental health illness. Its three components are Avoiding, Recognizing and Managing. 
                    These components work hand in hand to address the complexities of mental health issues. 
                    Since situations vary from person to person, these components are not in any particular order. 
                    They are just important points to keep in mind.  They can also be used as a way to educate people (even those not experiencing mental health issues) 
                    and to let them know what they can do to help.
