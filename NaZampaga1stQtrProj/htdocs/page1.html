            <p>
                Avoiding triggers and stressors should be done throughout the whole recovery process.
                Triggers can stimulate, intensify, and bring back unwanted behaviors. 
                It may be hard to avoid these especially if it is in the household, workspace, and environment. 
                That is why full family and peer support are very important.  Removal of oneself from the unhealthy environment is crucial.

            <p>
                Recognizing a problem is the most important step to start solving the problem. 
                One must first acknowledge that there is really a cause for concern. 
                Failing to do so or being in denial may result in a more severe condition. 
                Families, peers and school or work superiors may also be instrumental in recognizing these problems and in helping 
                the concerned individual see it from an outsider’s point of view.

            <p>
                Managing is addressing the problem head-on. This may be done by directing one’s focus to more productive and healthy diversions. 
                One should also build up sense of self confidence and create new habits to lessen stress and anxiety levels. 
                Asking for guidance from parents and other family members, meeting with the school’s guidance counsellor or seeking professional help 
                from a Psychiatrist or Psychologist are essential. 
                Managing is a concerted effort of the person and the people around him/her.
